    <p> I'm currently in a pathway called App Academy. We work with coding like with JavaScript and CSS. For my App Academy  class one of our projects that we were able to create was a customized map.  My map is based on European soccer stadiums. I have a passion for soccer so choosing the topic of my map was easy for me.  On the map, there are customized markers. Each marker represents where the stadium is located at. When the marker is clicked, a bit of information pops up. It displays both the name of the soccer club and the name of the stadium. There are fourteen markers. The marker has a bit of animation in the beginning. We used the Google Maps API to created the map. </p>
